Model Understanding of Core Intent
==================================

This crawler exists to build a reliable, structured corpus of trucking‑carrier
websites for analysis — not just summaries.

Core intent:
1) Capture meaningful content (text + images + code) for comparative analysis.
2) Preserve structure (section hierarchy + ordered blocks) for drill‑down.
3) Detect site capabilities (portals, tracking, integrations, API hints) from
   passive signals in HTML.
4) Archive raw HTML with hashes so re‑extraction is possible as tooling improves.
5) Maintain provenance and confidence so downstream analyses can trust or flag
   outputs.

Outcome: a consistent, navigable dataset that reflects how carriers present
capabilities, messaging, and tooling — suitable for longitudinal comparison,
feature discovery, and model‑assisted analysis.

Expanded Scope Note
-------------------
We want comprehensive capture: ALL text, images, and code — reliably tagged —
with a target of ~99% extraction success. This includes both:
- Main content (marketing copy, articles, features)
- Structural/UI content (nav, footer, tabs, accordions, selectors)
